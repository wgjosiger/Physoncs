# Physoncs

Currently, this is a modular Java program for exploring physics topics interactively via the command line.
More Fields are planned for in the future, E.G. Math
## Features
- Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, and Thermodynamics modules
- Sub-modules for Kinematics, Dynamics, Energy & Work, and more
- User-friendly menu navigation
- Example calculations and explanations
- Clear screen utility for better user experience

## Getting Started
1. Download this repository.
2. Open the project in VS Code or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile the code:
   ```
   javac main/Main.java
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```
   java main.Main
   ```

## Project Structure
- `main/` - Main Java source files
